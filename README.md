<h1>Keylogger in Python</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project focuses on creating a basic Python-based keylogger to explore how keylogging mechanisms operate. The goal is to emphasize the importance of cybersecurity awareness and responsible ethical hacking practices. By understanding how keyloggers work, we can better equip ourselves to identify and prevent potential threats, fostering a safer digital environment.

<br />

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
- <b>pynput: A Python library for monitoring and controlling input devices.</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11</b>

<h2>Project walk-through:</h2>

<p>
 Used the pynput library to build the keylogger.  <br/>
